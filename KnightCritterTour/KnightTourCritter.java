/**
 * In the beginning of the 19th century a practical method for solving
 * the  Knight's tour emerged. In "Des Resselsprungs einfachste und
 * allgemeinste Losung" (Schmalkalden, 1823) H. C. Warnsdorff presented
 * his method of constructing knight's tours.
 * 
 * The aim is to avoid creating dead ends - squares from which the
 * knight cannot get further without getting to an already visited
 * square. For that reason the possible squares to be chosen next are
 * examined before every move. One counts the number of free new
 * choices - entrances - every one of them has, and then moves
 * to the square with the lowest number of new choices. <br />
